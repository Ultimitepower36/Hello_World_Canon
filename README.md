# Overview
# Name : Canon Heise

The following program is a simple "Hello World" program that has been modified and reworked to print out 
the statements "Hello World.", "My name is Canon.", and "How are you?" onto the screen in many orders.

The program in all its simplicity, was created in order to get my barrings in the repository and coding
world. It was also made so that I could know what to expect for future projects.

# Development Environment

In order to make this project possible, I used a coding software called Visual Studio Code in order to 
make the code. In order to make the repository to share the code, I used Github. 

The code that I used for this project consists of the Python coding language. Advice for the code was
taken from the website StackOverflow.com. All the code is my own work, I just used the website to 
remember how to write it.
