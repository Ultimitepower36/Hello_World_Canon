# Overview
# Name : Canon Heise

The following program is a simple "Hello World" program that reads and prints out the words "Hello World"
onto the screen.

The program in all its simplicity, was created in order to get my barrings in the repository and coding
world. It was also made so that I could know what to expect for future projects.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
